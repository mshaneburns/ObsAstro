## Learning Python
All of the code and tutorials on this site assume you are at least somewhat familiar with Python programming. If you've taking beginning programing course in Python you will be well prepared to start the tutorials. If you need to learn Python before starting there are a vast number of online resources. Here's a list of a few free ones that I have found to be useful:

- [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/) is a very good introduction to learning programming using Python. 
- [Scientific Computing Toolbox](https://faculty1.coloradocollege.edu/~sburns/toolbox/index.html) is an elementary introduction to Python with special emphasis on software tools useful to science students.
- [Practical Python for Astronomers](https://python4astronomers.github.io/index.html) is a series of hands-on workshops with and emphasis on using Python to solve real-world problems that astronomers are likely to encounter in research.
- [Python for Astronomers](https://prappleizer.github.io) is a free textbook and set of interactive tutorials for learning scientific computing. It is intended for students and researchers just starting out with coding in an astrophysical research context.
